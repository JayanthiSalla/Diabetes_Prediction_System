# Diabetes_Prediction_System
Diabetes prediction system is used to predict whether the patient is suffering with diabetes or not.<br>It is built with Linear SVM(Support Vector Machine) a Machine Learning model.Here this model acts as a binary classifier i.e. It gives output either 1->Patient has diabetes or 0->Patient does'nt have diabetes.<br>
SVM=>It classifies the data by finding MMH(Maximum Marginal Hyperplane) which is found through support vectors.
